# generator

This is an ARM template generator for Couchbase.  It creates templates that leverage XDCR and MDS.

## Extremely Important Note!

This doesn't work yet.

## Deployment

Creating a deployment is really simple.  Run the [deploy.sh](deploy.sh) command with the name of a parameters file and the name of a resource group to create.  For instance:

    ./deploy.sh simple simpleresourcegroup

The generator will create an ARM template called generatedTemplate.json that matches the specs in the parameter file and deploy it to Azure.
